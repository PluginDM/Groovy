    SUMMARY:
    =======
    Let‚Äôs repeat the five mental model building blocks that we worked out:

    -------
    üß± With coroutines, it is possible to define blocks of code are executed only
    partially before returning the control flow back to the call site. This works because
    coroutines can be suspended at suspension points and then resumed at a later point in time.
    -------
    üß± Coroutines allow you to achieve concurrent behavior without switching threads, which
    results in more efficient code. Therefore, coroutines are often called ‚Äúlightweight threads‚Äù.
    -------
    üß± Coroutines can be seen as ABSTRACTIONS on top of threads. Different code blocks within the
    same coroutine can be executed in different threads.
    -------
    üß± The compiler transforms suspend functions into regular functions that receive an additional
    continuation . Depending on the state of the continuation, different code of the suspend function
    is executed. That‚Äôs how a coroutine can be split up into separately running code blocks.
    -------
    üß± delay() is not blocking its host thread because it, depending on the dispatcher, uses mechanisms
    like handler.postDelayed() . So it basically just schedules all subsequent operations of the
    coroutine to a later point in time.
    -------

    FINALLY:
    =======
    These building blocks have helped me a lot to finally wrap my head around coroutines and
    write better concurrent code.
